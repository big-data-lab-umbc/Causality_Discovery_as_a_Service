# Causality Discovery as a Service

## Data Driven Causality Discovery as a Service on Cloud VMs via script
In ./scripts folder, we provide bash scripts for setting causality Spark cluster. 
Before running scripts, you need to setup ssh permission for your cluster. Remember fill out all parameters before running scripts.
   

## Data Driven Causality Discovery as a Service on Amazon Web Service (AWS) EMR Cloud via SDK
We provide fabfile.py with run_interface.py for running causality on EMR automatically.
  
### Prerequirement  
Boto  
Invoke  
Paramiko  
Fabric2  

### 1. Get your own Access key and Secret key:   
   Go to account -> My security credentials -> Dashboard -> rotate your access key, create new access key, download the file (accessKeys.csv).  
  
### 2. Get your own key pair (Or upload your own public key):  
   (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair)   
	Go to EC2 -> Network security -> key pairs, create key pair, download the file (your_key_pair.pem).  
   Move to its path, and run 
   '''bash
	chmod 400 your_key_pair.pem 
   '''  
   Move file to .ssh folder, and run 
   '''bash
	mv path_to_key_pair .ssh  
   '''
  
### 3. Make a little change:  
   For run_interface.py, use your key pair name to replace key_name in config. Also change other config for your experiments.  
  
### 4. Start Causality Discovery Automation on AWS:  
	$python3 run_interface.py [access key] [secret key]  
	$RunCausality()  
	$DeleteCluster()  
  
### 5. Start Causality Discovery Step by Step:  
   $python3 run_interface.py [access key] [secret key]  
   $createCluster()  
   $hadoopSetting()  
   $prepare()  
   $start()  
   $DeleteCluster()  
    

## Data Driven Causality Discovery as a Service on AWS EMR Cloud via CloudFormation  
In ./CloudFormation folder, we provide tamplates for running causality on EMR automatically. 
  
### Start CloudFormation from: 
https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/  
  

## Data Driven Causality Discovery as a Service on AWS EMR Cloud via Serverless Application Model (SAM)  
In ./SAM folder, we provide tamplates for running causality on EMR automatically. 
  
### Prerequirement  
AWS SAM CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-linux.html  
  
### 1. Start SAM from your command line:  
	$sam validate -t ./CausalityAutomation.json 
	$sam build -t ./CausalityAutomation.json  
	$sam deploy --guided  

### 2. Send events:  
SampleEvent1 invokes by sending from AWS Lambda Function: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/.   
SampleEvent2 invokes by upload json files to AWS S3.
